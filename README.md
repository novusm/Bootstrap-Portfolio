# Bootstrap-Portfolio
A portfolio created using Bootstrap for the first time to build a webpage. 

## About

The portfolio page is an ongoing project which will be updated and improved as I move through this course but ultimately serves the first purpose of being a template for how to use Bootstrap as well as how to modify Bootstrap with my CSS. Overall this project serves to teach me about Bootstrap and how to customise it for my purposes
