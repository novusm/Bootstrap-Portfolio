A portfolio created using Bootstrap for the first time to build a webpage. 

## About

The portfolio page is an ongoing project which will be updated and improved as I move through this course but ultimately serves the first purpose of being a template for how to use Bootstrap as well as how to modify Bootstrap with it my css.
